The physical version of the card game is made using the same csv files for cards as the digital version and uses the free CardMaker program by Tim Stair (https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker).

Note that the csv file assumes all images are located in a directory called images directly under the CardMaker exe program. The csv files are assumed to be found under the CardMaker exe directory in a folder called csvFiles. If these directories are changed, then the main CardMaker setup file needs to change as well.

The full and quick instructions are included and there are a number of optional items for playing including an 11x17 playmat, a sheet of connectors to print and cut out, and a pdf with all current cards used in the game. Note that they may be printed out and backed by regular playing cards to allow for easier shuffling, and put into card sleeves.

The game requires a d20 die to roll for attacks (digital versions abound on the internet) as well as a way to show the connections between the stations (either string or the provided sheet of connectors). Additionally, it helps to use a marker to indicate points off of a station/facility. Coins or other common markers are easy to use.

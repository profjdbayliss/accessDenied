The physical version of the card game is made using the same csv files for cards as the digital version and uses the free CardMaker program by Tim Stair (https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker).

Note that the csv file assumes all images are located in a directory called images directly under the CardMaker exe program. The csv files are assumed to be found under the CardMaker exe directory in a folder called csvFiles. If these directories are changed, then the main CardMaker setup file needs to change as well.

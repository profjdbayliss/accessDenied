1,Vulnerability,any,Field Devices Vulnerable,0xff0000,images/HackingIncident.png,images/AttackBackground.png,1,-1,1,images/initialAccesss.png,0,1,Access gained via field devices. Field devices such as transformers and wind farms have a vulnerable technology like Bluetooth embedded that can't be turned off.
1,Vulnerability,any,Ransomware,0xff0000,images/ransomWare.png,images/AttackBackground.png,1,-2,4,,,,Your business machines have been infected with ransomware and all the hackers care about is that you pay them.
1,Vulnerability,any,Virus Checking Software Installed,0xff0000,images/SystemShutdown.png,images/AttackBackground.png,1,-1,2,,1,1,Somebody installed virus checking software that causes a denial of service attack of up to 6 minutes on the industrial control system because it interrupts real-time operations. The Denial of Service self attack was unintended.
1,Vulnerability,any,Control and Safety Implemented Together,0xff0000,images/ImplementedTogether.png,images/AttackBackground.png,1,-1,2,images/lateralMovement.png,,,Control and safety features are implemented into the same hardware. Safety is now vulnerable.
1,Vulnerability,any,Alarm Suppression,0xff0000,images/AlarmSuppression.png,images/AttackBackground.png,1,-1,2,,,,A local software misconfiguration or vulnerability is used to gain access and the alarm functionality of the system is suppressed.
1,Vulnerability,any,Lateral Movement,0xff0000,images/lateralMovement.png,images/AttackBackground.png,,,3,images/lateralMovement.png,3,1,The last played vulnerability on this station moves to all stations directly connected to it if the vulnerability becomes an actual attack.
1,Vulnerability,any,Offline,0xff0000,images/Blackout.png,images/AttackBackground.png,1,-2,4,images/impact.png,4,1,If a station survives this attack it will be offline and unusable for points the next turn.
1,Vulnerability,any,Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O,0xff0000,images/BruteForce.png,images/AttackBackground.png,1,-1,3,,5,1,Access gained and on/off commands were switched. Causes output to fluctuate unnaturally.
1,Instant,any,Authentication Provides Confidentiality,0xBF40BF,images/ransom.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,3,,0,2,(Instant) -1! Access and privacy are two separate things. You were logged in but your data was still stolen over that unencrypted wi-fi.
1,Mitigation,any,Change Password,0xFDFF9E,images/ChangePassword.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/initialAccesss.png,,,Make users choose a new and stronger password. Counters phishing and vulnerable field device vulnerabilities.
1,Mitigation,any,Firewall Log Review,0xFDFF9E,images/FirewallLogReview.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,Firewall logs are reviewed and lateral movement discovered. Cancels Lateral movement card.
1,Mitigation,any,Pay Ransom,0xFDFF9E,images/PayRansom.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,You pay the ransom. Roll dice and if you get a 19 or 20 you get all your data back. If you get greater than a 10 you get some data back and take a -1 damage to your facility. Lose all points for the attack if you get a 10 or below.
1,Mitigation,any,Restart and Patch,0xFDFF9E,images/RestartAndPatch.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,"System is restarted and patched. Roll a die to determine if the specialized ICS patch actually works for your facility. Failure is rolling a 1 or 2. Can fix Alarm Suppression, virus checking software installation, or Brute Force I/O. Failure means the attack happens."
1,Mitigation,any,Separate Functionality,0xFDFF9E,images/SeparateSafetyandControl.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,Mitigates control and safety implemented together. Separate safety and control system hardware functionality to increase security.
1,Mitigation,any,Repair Technician,0xFDFF9E,images/RepairTechnician.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/impact.png,1,2,"Send a repair technician to fix anything physical including brute force attacks, mechanical breakdowns, and offline facilities."
1,Mitigation,any,Run Analytics,0xFDFF9E,images/RunAnalytics.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/initialAccesss.png,,,Run analytics on user/system behavior to notice and then stop an outsider from accessing networks. Stops access from phishing and vulnerable field devices.
1,Halt,any,HALT,0xBF40BF,images/accessDenied.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,2,2,Cancels any instant action. Somebody was on the ball today.
1,Mitigation,power,Wrong IP,0xFDFF9E,images/WrongIP.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,Attacker uses the wrong IP for a relay switch open command and  nothing happens. Fixes Brute Force I/O and happened during 2016 Ukraine Power Grid Attack.
1,Defense,power,Patch Siemens Relay Exploit,0x00A36C,images/PatchExploit.png,images/DefenseBackground.png,1,+1,,images/impact.png,,, +1 to station. Patch Siemens mechanical relay exploit (stops any relay issues on that station).
1,Mitigation,power,Physically Reset Devices,0xFDFF9E,images/ResetAllDevices.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/impact.png,,,Physically reset devices in a facility. Used for Brute Force I/O and Stations that are not working. Can only be used on stations with the Siemens mechancial relay exploit patched or else station explodes (-5 pt) and life is lost.
1,Vulnerability,water,Sewage Dumped,0xff0000,images/Sewage.png,images/AttackBackground.png,1,-1,3,images/impact.png,3,2,(Water Only Vuln)  Brute Force I/O attack sends false messages via radio network to disable alarm reporting and corrupt a water pump system to run incorrectly. Can't be played on a station with upgraded SCADA access authentication.
1,Vulnerability,water,Mechanical Breakdown,0xff0000,images/MechanicalBreakdown.png,images/AttackBackground.png,1,-2,4,images/impact.png,,,(Water Only Vuln) Pump sewerage station stopped through mechanical error when equipment fails after being used incorrectly due to cyber attacks. Fixed through repair.

1,Instant,any,Compliance is Enough,0xBF40BF,images/ComplianceIsEnough.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,3,,,,(Instant) -1! Compliance does not equal complete security but your people believe it does. You drove a car with a valid driver's license at the proper speed limit. You still had an accident.
1,Instant,any,Authentication Provides Confidentiality,0xBF40BF,images/ransom.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,3,,0,2,(Instant) -1! Access and privacy are two separate things. You were logged in but your data was still stolen over that unencrypted wi-fi.
2,Mitigation,any,Change Password,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/initialAccesss.png,,,Make users choose a new and stronger password. Counters phishing and vulnerable field device vulnerabilities.
3,Mitigation,any,Firewall Log Review,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,Firewall logs are reviewed and lateral movement discovered. Cancels Lateral movement card.
1,Mitigation,any,Pay Ransom,0xFDFF9E,images/PayRansom.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,You pay the ransom. Roll dice and if you get a 19 or 20 you get all your data back. If you get greater than a 10 you get some data back and take a -1 damage to your facility. Lose all points for the attack if you get a 10 or below. Note that 80% of companies that pay the ransom are attacked a second time in the future.
2,Mitigation,any,Restart and Patch,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,"System is restarted and patched. Roll a die to determine if the specialized ICS patch actually works for your facility. Failure is rolling a 1 or 2. Can fix Alarm Suppression, virus checking software installation, Brute Force I/O, or Service Modification Malware. Failure means the attack happens."
3,Mitigation,any,Separate Functionality,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,Separate functionality to increase security. This can be business IT and Industrial Control System (ICS) functionality or even safety and control system hardware.

Used for Brute Force I/O and Stations that are not working. Can only be used on stations with the Siemens mechancial relay exploit patched or else station explodes (-5 pt) and life is lost.
1,Vulnerability,water,Sewage Dumped,0xff8888,images/WaterPipeBreakage.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,3,images/impact.png,3,2,(Used on Water Only)  Brute Force I/O attack sent false messages via radio network using a stolen machine to disable alarm reporting and corrupt a water pump system to run incorrectly.

1,Virus Checking Software Installed,0xff8888,images/SystemShutdown.png,images/red2.png,Somebody installed virus checking software that causes a denial of service attack of up to 6 minutes on the industrial control system because it interrupts real-time operations. The Denial of Service self attack was unintended.,1,-1,3,
1,Control and Safety Implemented Together,0xff8888,,images/red2.png,Control and safety features are implemented into the same hardware. Safety is now vulnerable.,1,-1,2,images/lateralMovement.png
2,Alarm Suppression,0xff8888,,images/red2.png,A local software misconfiguration or vulnerability is used to gain access and the alarm functionality of the system is suppressed.,1,-1,2,
2,Service Modification Malware,0xff8888,images/supplyChainCompromise.jpg,images/red2.png,Attackers use a service modification to load malware and gain access.,1,-1,2,
2,Functionality Not Separate,0xff8888,,images/red2.png,Your business and industrial control system networks aren’t completely separate or your control safety systems are on the same hardware. Anything not separated can be attacked together. ,1,-1,2,images/lateralMovement.png
4,Lateral Movement,0xff8888,images/lateralMovement.jpg,images/red2.png,Any vulnerabilities with this station move to all stations directly connected to it if the vulnerability becomes an actual attack.,,,3,images/lateralMovement.png
4,Offline,0xff8888,images/Blockout.png,images/red2.png,Station or substation offline. Something is wrong.,1,-2,4,images/impact.png
3,Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O,0xff8888,images/BruteForce.png,images/red2.png,Access gained and on/off commands were switched. Causes output to fluctuate unnaturally.,1,-1,3,
1,Compliance is Enough,0xff8888,,images/red2.png,"Instant -1! Compliance does not equal complete security, but your people believe it does. You drove a car with a valid driver's license, at the proper speed limit, with insurance, and a seatbelt. You still had an accident.",1,-1,3,
1,Authentication Provides Confidentiality,0xff8888,images/ransom.jpg,images/red2.png,"Instant -1! Access and privacy are two separate things. You were logged in, but your data was still stolen over that unencrypted wi-fi.",1,-1,3,
2,Change Password,0xFDFF9E,,images/yellow2.png,Maker users choose a new and stronger password. Counters phishing and vulnerable field device vulnerabilities.,,,,images/initialAccesss.png
4,Firewall Log Review,0xFDFF9E,,images/yellow2.png,Firewall logs are reviewed and lateral movement discovered. Cancels Lateral movement card.,,,,
2,Restart and Patch,0xFDFF9E,.,images/yellow2.png,"System is restarted and patched. Roll a die to determine if the specialized ICS patch actually works for your facility. Failure is rolling a 1 or 2. Can fix Alarm Suppression, virus checking software installation, Brute Force I/O, or Service Modification Malware. Failure means the attack happens.",,,,
3,Separate Functionality,0xFDFF9E,,images/yellow2.png,Separate functionality to increase security. This can be business IT and Industrial Control System (ICS) functionality or even safety and control system hardware.,,,,
3,Repair Technician,0xFDFF9E,images/RepairTechnician.png,images/yellow2.png,"Send a repair technician to fix anything physical including brute force attacks, mechanical breakdowns, and offline facilities.",,,,images/impact.png
1,Run Analytics,0xFDFF9E,,images/yellow2.png,Run analytics on user/system behavior to notice and then stop an outsider from accessing networks. Stops access from phishing and vulnerable field devices.,,,,images/initialAccesss.png
2,HALT,0xFDFF9E,images/HALT.jpg,images/yellow2.png,Cancels any instant action. Somebody was on the ball today.,,,,
2,Wrong IP,0xFDFF9E,,images/yellow2.png,"(Power Only) Attacker uses the wrong IP for a relay switch open command, so nothing happens. Fixes Brute Force I/O and happened during 2016 Ukraine Power Grid Attack.",,,,
2,Patch Siemens Relay Exploit,0x6699ff,,images/blue2.png,(Power Only) +1 to station. Patch Siemens mechanical relay exploit (stops any relay issues on that station).,1,+1,,images/impact.png
1,Physically Reset Devices,0xFDFF9E,,images/yellow2.png,(Power Only) Physically reset devices in a facility. Used for Brute Force I/O and Stations that are not working. Can only be used on stations with the Siemens mechancial relay exploit patched or else station explodes and life is lost.,,,,images/impact.png
1,Sewage Dumped,0xff8888,images/WaterPipeBreakage.png,images/red2.png,(Water Only)  Brute Force I/O attack sent false messages via radio network using a stolen machine to disable alarm reporting and corrupt a water pump system to run incorrectly. Can't be played on a staion with upgraded SCADA access authentication.,1,-1,3,images/impact.png
1,Mechanical Breakdown,0xff8888,,images/red2.png,(Water Only) Pump sewerage station stopped through mechanical error after equipment fails having been used incorrectly due to cyber attacks. Fixed through repair.,1,-2,4,images/impact.png

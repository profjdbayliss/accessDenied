**Objective**: A fork of the resilience card game project for non-cybersecurity people. It's meant to help folks learn some basics about cybersecurity through learning attack and mitigation terms from the MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE ICS Matrices to help people become more productive when they participate in a scenario or wargame with cybersecurity components after.

**Educational Goals**

- Education, but not training
- Linking attacks to defense/mitigation
- Considering control system breaches (even below SCADA)
- Using information from real world events in cards:
  - 2000 Maroochy Water Services, Australia (water treatment)
  - 2016 Kyiv power grid cyber attack (power)

**Instructions**

There are two versions of the game in this repository - the physical card game and the digital version of the same game made with the Unity game engine. Full instructions for how to play are in the physical card game directory.

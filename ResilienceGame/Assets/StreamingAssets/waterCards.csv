3,Vulnerability,any,Field Devices Vulnerable,0xff8888,images/HackingIncident.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,1,images/initialAccesss.png,5,0,,"Access gained via field devices. Some of many field devices such as transformers, circuit breakers, wind farms, etc. have a vulnerable technology like Bluetooth embedded that can't be turned off."
1,Vulnerability,any,Control and Safety Implemented Together,0xff8888,,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,2,images/lateralMovement.png,,,,Control and safety features are implemented into the same hardware. Safety is now vulnerable.
2,Vulnerability,any,Functionality Not Separate,0xff8888,,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,2,images/lateralMovement.png,,,,Your business and industrial control system networks aren’t completely separate or your control safety systems are on the same hardware. Anything not separated can be attacked together.

3,Vulnerability,any,Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O,0xff8888,images/BruteForce.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,3,,4,1,,Access was gained and on/off commands were switched. Causes output to fluctuate unnaturally.
2,Mitigation,any,Change Password,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/initialAccesss.png,,,Vulnerable to Phishing;Field Devices Vulnerable,Maker users choose a new and stronger password. Counters phishing and vulnerable field device vulnerabilities.
3,Mitigation,any,Separate Functionality,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,Functionality Not Separate;Control and Safety Implemented Together,Separate functionality to increase security. This can be business IT and Industrial Control System (ICS) functionality or even safety and control system hardware.
3,Mitigation,any,Repair Technician,0xFDFF9E,images/RepairTechnician.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,0,2,Offline;Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O;Mechanical Breakdown;Sewage Dumped;Power Fluctuation,"Send a repair technician to fix anything physical including brute force attacks, mechanical breakdowns, and offline facilities."
1,Mitigation,any,Run Analytics,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/initialAccesss.png,,,Vulnerable to Phishing;Field Devices Vulnerable,Run analytics on user/system behavior to notice and then stop an outsider from accessing networks. Stops access from phishing and vulnerable field devices.
2,Mitigation,water,Catch Rogue Employee,0xFDFF9E,images/CatchRogueEmployee.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/impact.png,2,2,Offline;Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O;Mechanical Breakdown;Sewage Dumped;Power Fluctuation,"(Water Only) Catch previous employee sending false messages to radio network and causing them to dump sewage at a Hyatt Regency hotel . Fixes Brute Force I/O, sewage dump, or offline station and happened during 2000 Maroochy Water Services, Australian attack."
2,Defense,water,Upgrade SCADA Access Authentication,0x6699ff,,images/CardBackground.png,1,1,,images/impact.png,,,Sewage Dumped;Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O,(Water Only) +1 to station. Upgrade access authentication for SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) radio network so previous employees can no longer use it.
1,Mitigation,water,Upgrade Control System,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/impact.png,,,Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O,(Water Only) Upgrade control system and information integrity to not accept outside/false messages that could be sent by attackers. Stops Brute Force I/O Attacks and Alarm Suppression.

1,Defense,any,Hire Cybersecurity Expert,0x6699ff,images/hireExpert.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,1,,,0,0,,Operates as +1 to station played on and can protect any station within a single connection. Goes away upon successful attack and nullifies a single attack OR can be used to nullify a lateral movement card on any station within its sphere of influence.
1,Defense,any,Old Style Forensics Capability,0x6699ff,,images/CardBackground.png,1,1,,,,,,Operates as +1 to station. A forensics tool for old style modems bought. Issues can now be ascertained on fifteen- to  twenty-five year old hardware. 
1,Defense,any,Train employees,0x6699ff,images/trainEmployees.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,1,,,1,0,,Operates as +1 to station. Train employees in ICS cybersecurity. IT and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have different security needs.

3,Vulnerability,any,Vulnerable to Phishing,0xff8888,images/phishing.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,1,images/initialAccesss.png,5,0,,Employees opened email and either clicked a link or opened an attachment sent from an attacker.
3,Vulnerability,any,Field Devices Vulnerable,0xff8888,images/HackingIncident.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,1,images/initialAccesss.png,0,1,,Access gained via field devices. Some of many field devices such as transformers and wind farms have a vulnerable technology like Bluetooth embedded that can't be turned off.
1,Vulnerability,any,Control and Safety Implemented Together,0xff8888,,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,2,images/lateralMovement.png,,,,Control and safety features are implemented into the same hardware. Safety is now vulnerable.
2,Vulnerability,any,Functionality Not Separate,0xff8888,,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,2,images/lateralMovement.png,,,,Your business and industrial control system networks aren’t completely separate or your control safety systems are on the same hardware. Anything not separated can be attacked together. 
4,Vulnerability,any,Offline,0xff8888,images/Blackout.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-2,4,images/impact.png,4,1,,Station or substation offline. Something is wrong.
3,Vulnerability,any,Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O,0xff8888,images/BruteForce.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,3,,5,1,,Access gained and on/off commands were switched. Causes output to fluctuate unnaturally.
2,Mitigation,any,Change Password,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/initialAccesss.png,,,Vulnerable to Phishing;Field Devices Vulnerable,Maker users choose a new and stronger password. Counters phishing and vulnerable field device vulnerabilities.
3,Mitigation,any,Separate Functionality,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,Functionality Not Separate;Control and Safety Implemented Together,Separate functionality to increase security. This can be business IT and Industrial Control System (ICS) functionality or even safety and control system hardware.
3,Mitigation,any,Repair Technician,0xFDFF9E,images/RepairTechnician.png,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/impact.png,1,2,Offline;Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O;Mechanical Breakdown;Sewage Dumped;Power Fluctuation,"Send a repair technician to fix anything physical including brute force attacks, mechanical breakdowns, and offline facilities."
1,Mitigation,any,Run Analytics,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/initialAccesss.png,,,Vulnerable to Phishing;Field Devices Vulnerable,Run analytics on user/system behavior to notice and then stop an outsider from accessing networks. Stops access from phishing and vulnerable field devices.
2,Mitigation,power,Wrong IP,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,,,,Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O;Denial of Service Exploit Shutdown;Power Fluctuation,(Power Only) Attacker uses the wrong IP for a relay switch open command and  nothing happens. Fixes Brute Force I/O and happened during 2016 Ukraine Power Grid Attack.
2,Defense,power,Patch Siemens Relay Exploit,0x6699ff,,images/CardBackground.png,1,1,,images/impact.png,,,Denial of Service Exploit Shutdown,(Power Only) +1 to station. Patch Siemens mechanical relay exploit (stops any relay issues on that station).
1,Mitigation,power,Physically Reset Devices,0xFDFF9E,,images/CardBackground.png,,,,images/impact.png,,,Offline;Output Fluctuates Through Brute Force I/O,(Power Only) Physically reset devices in a facility. Used for Brute Force I/O and Stations that are not working. Can only be used on stations with the Siemens mechancial relay exploit patched or else station explodes and life is lost.
1,Vulnerability,water,Sewage Dumped,0xff8888,images/WaterPipeBreakage.png,images/CardBackground.png,1,-1,3,images/impact.png,3,2,,(Water Only)  Brute Force I/O attack sent false messages via radio network using a stolen machine to disable alarm reporting and corrupt a water pump system to run incorrectly. Can't be played on a station with upgraded SCADA access authentication.
1,Vulnerability,water,Mechanical Breakdown,0xff8888,,images/CardBackground.png,1,-2,4,images/impact.png,,,,(Water Only) Pump sewerage station stopped through mechanical error after equipment fails having been used incorrectly due to cyber attacks. Fixed through repair.
